##Â What is it ? 

The zimletPlus zimlet allows the Zimbra users to add their own shortcuts to other websites. The shortcuts are represented by additional tabs that the users can easily access while browsing the webmail.

## How to make use of the zimlet

 * Click on the Zimlet + label in the Zimlet panel.
 * To create a new shortcut, simply type in the name you wish to give it and set it an url.
 * Validate your new shortcut(s) by clicking on the "Validate" button.
 
## Notes 
 
Not all websites can be added into the tabs : some will deny the request to be embedded into an external Iframe. It has to do with the X-Frame-Option http header that the remote server has to allow
